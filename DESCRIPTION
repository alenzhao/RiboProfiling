Description: Starting with a BAM file, this package provides the
        necessary functions for quality assessment, read start position
        recalibration, the counting of reads on CDS, 3'UTR, and 5'UTR,
        plotting of count data: pairs, log fold-change, codon frequency
        and coverage assessment, principal component analysis on codon
        coverage.
